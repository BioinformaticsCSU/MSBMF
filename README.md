# MSBMF
Based on multiple similarities of drug and disease, we propose a Multi-Similarities Bilinear Matrix Factorization algorithm to identify potential novel indications for known or novel drugs.
The code of MSBMF in this package is implemented in Matlab2014a.

# Description 
"Demo.m" demonstrates the experimental result on Fdataset_ms by MSBMF algorithm.

"MSBMF.m" is the function of MSBMF algorithm.
